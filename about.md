# About me

<p>
I am a software engineer, architect, technical product owner. More than two decades ago, I
have started as Java and C developer in the IT industry and worked at a few multinational
technology companies (Northern Telecom, Hewlett-Packard, Siemens) in various positions
spanning from SW engineering to technical account management. In the mid-2000s I turned
to the automotive business to continue my career and co-developed infotainment software
modules and applications for major car makers in Germany. Almost two years back, I joined
the group of location-based services that taught me a lot and expanded my
horizon. Having begun in the Positioning team I lastly landed in the ADAS group to
consolidate the activities in highly automated driving
